**Overview**

Sharks are carnivorous sea animals that attack humans.

This project reveals the rate of shark attack annually over time since 1900 as well as the trends. 

The analysis also gives interesting details of the most attacked body part by these sharks,  the time of the day shark attack is most prevalent. Also, this analysis gives a very lucid details on the country and areas where shark attack occurs.

Significantly, my analysis was able to tell the most common type of shark species involved in the attack.

**Problem Statement**
Through this analysis we can see how dangerous these attacks by the sharks can be. The analysis shows the hours of the day when most of the attack happen, making it easy to predict the attack and possibly avoid been attacked.

**Steps Followed**
1.	I Loaded the data into Power BI Desktop dataset in a CSV file format.
2.	Opened it in power query editor and in view tab under Data preview section check; ‘column distribution’, ‘column quality’ and ‘column profile’ options.
3.	So much data cleaning was done to make the data good enough for analysis
4.	Text analysis was done to be able to get the most attacked body part
5.	Data Transformation and modelling.
6.	I made use of conditional column to extract the week day name and month name.
7.	Calculations using DAX functions.
8.	Preparation of visualization canvas and customizing.
9.	Addition of visual cards and chats to the canvas.
10.	Addition of visual filter (slicers) were added to the canvas.
